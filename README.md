# CBQA frontend candidate test
Thank you for your interest on being part of the CBQA family, in order to continue with the hiring process you have to complete this exercise.

# Intructions
* Do not install another library, use the ones included in the project.
* Fork the repo and email the url to `engineering@cbqasolutions.com` once it's ready to review
* Fetch this data api `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/`
* Group tasks using `userId` response property so all tasks are grouped by userId, something like this
 - userId1
   -- task 1
   -- task 2
 - userId2
   -- task 3
   -- task 4
* You can toogle tasks to be completed
* Complete and no completed tasks must be visually different from each other, feel free to implement the css stuff necesary to achieve it.
* Track completed/no completed tasks of each group somehow visually, up to you how you want to handle this

# Bonus
* Feel free to unit test your code if you want, that would give you a HUGE plus when we review it
* Feel free to add the css you want and show off your skills, this is your moment!
* Once finished push your changes and let us know via email so one of our experts can take a look at it.

Good luck!
